# CI_project1
This repository contains code for network propagation, file generation and gene enrichment analysis
The file generation jupyter notebook is to generate indication_to_protein.tsv and food molecule_to_protein.tsv, both of which are used to substitute the datasets used in the orginal pre-trained model.
Network propagation file is to generate diffusion profiles for food molecules and the indication of lung adenocarcinoma and it is mainly derived from the pre-trained model.
We used three separate methods to do gene enrichment analysis. The one using python package "GSEAPY" was enclosed in the python jupyter notebook and other two
methods were performed by R and were enclosed in R_gene_enrichment_analysis.
